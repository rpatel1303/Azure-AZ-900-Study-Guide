Azure Fundamentals
----------------------------


High Availability 
	Maintain Acceptable Continuous performance under varying load and failure (mainly failures)
Fault Tolerance
	System's ability to continue operating properly when component fails (faulty)
Disaster Recovery
	System's ability to recover after disaster (think restore)

Scalability
	System's ability to increase the instance count or size of existing resource (scaling out/scaling up)
Elasticity
	System's ability to increase or decrease instance count or size. 

Business Agility 
	Organization's ability to rapidly adapt to market

Economies of Scale 
	Bulk Discount

Capital Expenditure/Operational Expenditure 
	CapEx 												OpEx
		Upfront investment								No upfront investment
		benefits over long period of time				immediate benefits
		non-recurring									recurring costs
		permanent assets								no permanent assets

Consumption Based Model
	Pay as you go

IaaS - Infrastructure as a Service			  --> THINK HOSTING (Think VM/Virtual Networks)
	Networking/Storage/Servers/Virtualization --> Managed by Vendor
	OS and above 							  --> Managed by client

PaaS - Platform as a Service				  --> THINK BUILD (Azure services like Storage/Search/SQL)
	Data and Application 					  --> Managed by Client
	Rest everything else 					  --> Managed by Vendor

SaaS - Software as a Service				  --> THINK CONSUME (SalesForce/Office 365)
	Full stack managed by Vendor


Public Cloud Model
	Multi Tenant implementation
	Bound by multi tenant data management policies
	Owned and operated by Cloud provider
	Same self service capabilities of private cloud model

	Two Org or client may be sharing hardware level resources


Private Cloud Model
	Single tenant implementation
	Isolated resources in Azure
	Higher level of security
	more expensive

	Define your own data management policies
	Self service capabilities

Hybrid Cloud Model
	Combination of public and private Cloud model
	cloud bursting is an option
		that is when resources fail or spike in demand, organization can burst through public cloud
	Use public cloud for less senstive application like emails etc.
	Use private cloud for senstive applications
	Can also be combination of on-prem and public cloud
